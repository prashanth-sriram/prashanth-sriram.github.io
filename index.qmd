# Welcome to Muscle Memory Data Science!

There is a lot to data science, but in our day-to-day work we tend to use only a tiny bit of it. But it's a different bit every day - and I hate forgetting what I've learned. The best way to not go back to square one is to develop some "Muscle Memory" through practice and documentation.

There are no advanced concepts on this blog - just basic stuff that I want to practice, staying up-to-date on the latest tools, and so on. But just because it's simple doesn't mean it's not useful. Hope this helps you in some little way!
